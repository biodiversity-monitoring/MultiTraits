\title{Calculate Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) Plant Ecology Strategy Scheme}
\usage{
LHS(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing plant trait measurements with required columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{SLA}: Specific leaf area (area per unit dry mass of mature leaves)
\item \code{Height}: Plant height at maturity (canopy height)
\item \code{SeedMass}: Seed mass
}
All values must be positive numbers. NA values are not allowed.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the original data plus additional columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{L}: Percentage contribution of leaf strategy (0-100)
\item \code{H}: Percentage contribution of height strategy (0-100)
\item \code{S}: Percentage contribution of seed strategy (0-100)
\item \code{type}: Classified LHS strategy type based on dominant traits
}
}
\description{
The LHS scheme provides a quantitative framework for positioning any vascular
land plant species within a three-dimensional strategy space without requiring
time-consuming measurements of metabolic rates or field performance relative
to other species. All three axes are log-scaled, and the strategy of a species
is described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes.

The three traits represent fundamental trade-offs:
\itemize{
\item \strong{SLA (Specific Leaf Area)}: Light-capturing area deployed per
dry mass allocated. Reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities
for rapid growth.
\item \strong{Height}: Canopy height at maturity. Related to competitive ability
for light and coping with disturbance duration.
\item \strong{Seed Mass}: Reflects dispersal capabilities and seedling
establishment strategies, expressing separate aspects of coping with disturbance.
}

\details{
This function implements the LHS (Leaf-Height-Seed) plant ecology strategy scheme
proposed by Westoby (1998). The LHS scheme uses three fundamental plant traits
to characterize plant strategies: specific leaf area (SLA), plant height at maturity,
and seed mass. These three axes reflect well-established trade-offs that have
substantial consequences for how species cope with their physical environment
and biotic interactions.

The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Log-transforms all three trait values to handle the wide range of variation
\item Applies translation method to ensure all log-transformed values are positive
\item Normalizes values to percentages that sum to 100 for each species
\item Classifies each species into one of 19 predefined LHS strategy types
based on the closest match in the three-dimensional space
}

The LHS scheme allows for worldwide comparison of plant strategies and facilitates
meta-analysis across species from different regions, as it provides an explicit
protocol for determining a species' position without relying on local-context
information.
}
\note{
This implementation assumes that differences in these traits between species
are ecologically meaningful, while recognizing that the traits may show some
environmental modulation and genetic variation within species.
